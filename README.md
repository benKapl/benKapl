## Hi, I'm Benjamin
- 🖥️ I'm  a **Web Developer** passionate about learning and building stuffs!
- 🎯 I used to be a Product Manager. It turns out I prefer focusing on the **How** more than the **What**.
- 🎓 I have a French degree (RNCP6) in **web and mobile development** from [La Capsule](https://www.lacapsule.academy/) and almost finished stuying the whole [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) career path.
- ⚙️ I have learned **Fullstack Technologies**  and apply them in my projects, but my heart goes to **Backend Development**
- 🦫 I'm learning Go and Docker at the moment. 🐋
